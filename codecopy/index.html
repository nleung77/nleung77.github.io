        <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
        <p>I have a goal to take my knowledge of PCs and hardware, and combining it with the coding skills I learn at GA. I have 6 years of mobile, PC, and mobile electronics repair. I have some prior professional experience as well with data analytics and quality assurance testing. My knowledge on all computer OS and mobile OS, with a understanding of how hardware and software work together, will really be a tool for me to exploit. I also have alot of direct customer experience, as I have been in both the customer service and customer relations fields.</p>

        <h2>Outside The Workplace</h2>
        <p>I am an avid sports card collector and seller. I have my own business on a live auction platform called <strong>WhatNot</strong>, which allows you to buy and auction off a vast selection of products (clothing, sneakers, estate sales, funko pops, TCG cards, sports cards). I also am a big drone fan; I'm currently trying to pick up the skills of drone photography and videography.</p>
